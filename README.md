# SPRINT 4 / IT Academy/ APIs

## Introduction
In this exercise we fetch two APIs using TypeScript.
We have a simple application for a company's staff which displays some basic information about the current weather/temperature. This application also shows a random joke gotten from an API. We use three different joke APIs so that the staff won't get bored with by reading jokes of the same topic every day. The employees can also rate the joke, if they want, and the total score is saved in an array.

## FILE DETAILS
This website is built by using HTML, CSS and TypeScript. These are all the fetched APIs:

_https://yahoo-weather5.p.rapidapi.com_

_https://www.el-tiempo.net_

_https://jokes-always.p.rapidapi.com/family_

_https://icanhazdadjoke.com/_

_https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random_

## INSTALLATION
You can clone this repo by the following command: git clone https://github.com/Mika7596/S4_API or you can also download the zip file and execute it on your PC.

**Remember to uncomment the "getWeather()" and "fetchAJoke()" function invocations on lines 13 and 14 of my script.ts file.**
